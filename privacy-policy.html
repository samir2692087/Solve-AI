    <h1>Solve AI – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24 November 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Solve AI</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles
      information when you use the Solve AI application and website
      (collectively, the “Service”).
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>1. About Solve AI</h2>
    <p>
      Solve AI is an advanced calculator and AI assistant that helps with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scientific and basic calculations</li>
      <li>GST and EMI calculations</li>
      <li>Unit and currency conversions</li>
      <li>Age calculations and other utilities</li>
      <li>Step-by-step AI-generated solutions for math problems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Solve AI is designed with privacy in mind. We keep data collection to the
      absolute minimum required to operate and improve the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Solve AI is built to work <strong>without creating user accounts</strong> and
      <strong>without requiring personal identity information</strong> such as your name,
      address, or government ID.
    </p>

    <h3>2.1 Calculator & Input Data</h3>
    <p>When you use the app, you may enter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Numbers, expressions, and formulas</li>
      <li>Text math problems or questions</li>
      <li>Optional images or screenshots of problems (when you use image solve / OCR)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is used <strong>only to perform the requested calculation or AI
      response</strong>. We do not use it to build personal profiles or identify you.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Image Data (when using camera / gallery)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Images are processed to detect text and math expressions.</li>
      <li>Processing may happen on your device and/or securely on our AI provider’s servers (for example, Google Gemini).</li>
      <li>Images are not used for advertising, biometric identification, or facial recognition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Device & Technical Information</h3>
    <p>
      To keep the Service secure and improve performance, some technical
      information may be processed automatically, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
      <li>Browser or in-app WebView information (for PWA / web version)</li>
      <li>Basic crash or error logs</li>
      <li>Approximate time and date of use</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is generally <strong>non-personal</strong> and cannot directly identify you.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 No Sensitive Categories Collected</h3>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect or request sensitive categories of
      data such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Race or ethnicity</li>
      <li>Religious or political beliefs</li>
      <li>Health, medical, or biometric data</li>
      <li>Sexual orientation or behavior</li>
      <li>Financial account numbers or payment card numbers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To provide core features</strong> – performing calculations, conversions, and AI solutions requested by you.</li>
      <li><strong>To operate the Service</strong> – keeping servers, APIs, and hosting functioning correctly.</li>
      <li><strong>To improve stability and security</strong> – diagnosing crashes or errors and protecting against abuse and fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell data to advertisers or data brokers</li>
      <li>Create advertising profiles or interest-based advertising</li>
      <li>Track you across other apps or websites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Solve AI may interact with carefully selected third-party services to
      deliver functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AI & Math Solving APIs</strong>  
        For example, Google Gemini or other AI services may receive the text or
        image of the problem you choose to solve. This is necessary to generate
        step-by-step solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Currency Rate Provider</strong>  
        Currency conversions may use external APIs (such as Open Exchange Rates or similar) to fetch current exchange rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hosting & Delivery</strong>  
        The web version of the app is hosted by providers such as Vercel or GitHub Pages.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These providers may have access to limited technical data (IP address,
      request logs, etc.) as part of their normal operation. Their use of
      information is governed by their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Local Storage & Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The app may store small pieces of data locally on your device (for example, preferences, theme, or last used mode).</li>
      <li>The web/PWA version may use browser storage or cookies only for functionality (not for advertising tracking).</li>
      <li>You can clear this data at any time using your browser or device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculator inputs and AI prompts are processed in real time and are not stored by us as long-term personal records.</li>
      <li>Any technical logs (if stored) are kept only as long as necessary for security, debugging, and legal compliance, then deleted or anonymized.</li>
      <li>We do not maintain user accounts or persistent personal profiles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your data. We may share data only in these
      limited cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers</strong> – such as hosting or AI API providers, strictly to operate the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal requirements</strong> – if we are required by law, court order, or governmental request to disclose certain information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security and abuse prevention</strong> – to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, or security issues.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Solve AI can be used by students and learners; however, it is intended to
      be used with the guidance of a parent, guardian, or teacher for younger
      users.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</li>
      <li>If you believe that a child has provided personal data, please contact us so we can remove it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, your data may be processed on servers located
      in other countries (for example, where our hosting or AI providers are based).
      These countries may have different data protection laws than your own.
      We take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and
      in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights & Controls</h2>
    <p>
      Because Solve AI does not maintain user accounts or long-term personal
      records, the amount of data we can associate with you personally is very limited.
      However, where applicable law gives you rights (such as under GDPR or
      similar laws), you may:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Request information about any personal data that might be associated with you, if any;</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of that data, where technically feasible;</li>
      <li>Object to certain types of processing where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise these rights, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:mohammadsamir2424@gmail.com">mohammadsamir2424@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We use HTTPS and other reasonable technical measures to protect data in transit.</li>
      <li>No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; however, we aim to minimize the amount of data handled and reduce risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>
      The app or its description pages may contain links to third-party
      websites (for example, documentation, support pages, or external
      resources). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those
      sites. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies separately.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
      the app or legal requirements. The “Last updated” date at the top of this
      page indicates when it was last revised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued use of the Service after changes are posted means you accept the
      updated Policy.
    </p>
